Project:   <clotho> (need to change as POPSIM is another project)

DESCRIPTION
    
    <clotho> is a forward-time population genetics simulation engine.  The
goal of the project is to provide a powerful and flexible simulation engine.
The project should be able to take full advantage of the hardware resources
available at the time of execution.

    The engine is written in C/C++.

    Clotho was one of the Three Fates in Greek mythology.  She spun the thread
of human life, and was responsible for deciding when a person was born, and 
therefore their lives.

OVERVIEW
    - System Requirements


SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
    - Boost 1.54.0 (or higher)
    - OpenCL 1.1 (or higher) and supported hardware
    - Warped (https://github.com/putnampp/pdes)

USEFUL COMMANDS:

Compilation Variable: MAX_ALLELES
Description: The MAX_ALLELES variable is used to define the maximum number of forms a locus is
    allowed to have. In other words, locus, l, can have allele, a, is an enumerated value
    in [0, MAX_ALLELES).
Example Command: if [ ! -d build ]; then mkdir build; fi; cd build; cmake -DMAX_ALLELES=2 ..
    From the project's root directory, the above command in the above command
    will create a new directory 'build' will be created,
    in which the cmake command will create the makefiles with the MAX_ALLELES set
    to 2.  The number of alleles can be increased to any positive integer [0, (2^64)-1].
    The MAX_ALLELES variable is used to define the maximum number of forms a locus is
    allowed to have. In other words, locus, l, can have allele, a, is an enumerated value
    in [0, MAX_ALLELES).

Compilation Variable: Warped_DIR
Description: The Warped_DIR variable establishes the root directory for the Warped Libraries.
    Specifically, the Warped Utils (libutils.so) and the Warped (libwarped.so) files.
Example Command: cmake -DWarped_DIR=<path> ..
    This command will update the Warped root directory
