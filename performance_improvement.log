TEST NAME: STL Random

Modified ConstantPopulationRandomMatingModel to make use of STL Random functionality which
is "newly" available as of C++11.  Replaced the RAND Random Number Generator with the
std::mt19937, the STL equivalent.  Added a std::uniform_real_distribution member object
to the class.  Replaced all instances of RAND.Uniform with STL equivalent call to
uniform_real_distribution.

Ran sample generation based simulation with 10,000 individual per generation, 10,000
independent (neutral) loci per individual, promiscuous mating population, and 100
generations.  When using RAND RNG, this simulation ran to completion (excluding file
I/O time) in around 114 seconds.  The STL Random based simulation required nearly
double the amount of simulation time at 222 seconds.
